# What is Vibrowser?

**Vibrowser is a web browser built from scratch in C++17.**

No WebKit. No Blink. No Gecko. Just raw code, built line by line, in public.

## Why?

Because browsers are too important to be black boxes. We use them for everything—work, entertainment, communication—yet most of us have no idea how they actually work. Vibrowser exists to change that.

## What exists today

- HTML/CSS parser pipeline
- Selector matching and style resolution  
- JavaScript subset for DOM/style mutation
- Layout engine and paint system
- Output to .ppm image files
- Scripted smoke tests and fixtures

## What we're building toward

A complete, usable browser engine. The kind you could actually use to browse the web. It's a long road, but we're walking it in public.
