## Current Status

**Phase**: Active Development — Feature Implementation (Full Web Engine Roadmap)
**Last Active**: 2026-03-01
**Current Focus**: Round 25 feature implementation
**Momentum**: Cycle 1963 — 23 commits pushed across sessions. 13/13 tests passing.
**Cycle**: 1963
**Workflow**: Multi-phase feature implementation. Use 4-6 Sonnet subagents in parallel. Commit and push after each round.
**User Issue**: All user-reported centering/layout bugs FIXED. DPR viewport scaling FIXED. Mac UI white blank area NOT a bug.

**IMPORTANT**: When running parallel agents, always do a `rm -rf build && cmake -S . -B build` clean rebuild after agents finish, since concurrent file modifications can create stale .o files that link incorrectly. `/screenshot 2` to see the current state after build.

**DO NOT SEE AT HISTORY BACKUP**: since it contains a lot of informations w/ context overfilling issues.

**ALWAYS USE `codex` or `codex-spark` SUBAGENTS. (USE LATTER UNLESS RATE LIMITED)**

**GENERAL-PURPOSE or CLAUDE's OWN SUBAGENTS SHALL BE ALWAYS DONE WITH HAIKU MODEL**

**CSS color parsing key**: `parse_color()` in `value_parser.cpp` handles ALL CSS color types. It has helpers `extract_func_args()` and `parse_func_values()` that normalize commas/slashes/%/deg/turn/rad suffixes. The `color-mix()` and `light-dark()` have FALLBACK parsing for space-separated args (CSS tokenizer strips commas in function bodies).

**Paren-aware splitting**: `split_whitespace_paren()` in render_pipeline.cpp respects parentheses — use it for any CSS property that accepts function values (border, border-color, box-shadow, etc.).

**Screenshot preference**: Use current window position and size — do NOT reposition the window before capturing.

**CSS Nesting (Cycle 114)**: `parse_style_rule()` now detects nested rules inside parent rule blocks. Detection: `is_nested_rule_start()` checks for `&`, `.`, `#`, `[`, `:`, `>`, `+`, `~`, `*` tokens at statement start. `&` in nested selector is replaced with parent selector text. No `&` = implicit descendant nesting (parent prepended). Nested rules flatten as top-level rules after parent. Does NOT support double-nesting (nested rules inside nested rules) yet.

## Session Log

### Cycle 1963 (Round 24 Feature Implementation) — 2026-03-01

- **Theme**: 6 Sonnet subagent feature round — CSS transitions runtime, min/max constraints, background-size, event bubbling, opacity, meta/link tags
- **Commits**: 59664a4, 48fe96c, 2b7d1da, 8bf3ed9
- **Features Implemented**:
  - CSS transitions runtime: 60fps NSTimer animation loop via render_has_active_animations(), auto-stop
  - Min/max width/height: percentage resolution, aspect ratio preservation when max-width clamps images, InlineBlock containing_width fix
  - Background-size: percentage flags, cover/contain, space/round repeat modes, proper position keyword encoding
  - JS event bubbling: composedPath spec-compliant ordering, window capture/bubble, isTrusted, stopImmediatePropagation
  - Opacity: applied to box-shadows (outer+inset) and text-shadows, visibility:hidden child override
  - Meta/link tags: charset, description, theme-color (applied to window chrome), canonical URL, favicon priority scoring
  - Image aspect ratio: proportional height scaling in both layout_inline and layout_block when max-width clamps
- **Also fixed**: 4 paint test API migrations (bg_position sentinel → percentage flags), animation_controller.h
- **Validation**: 13/13 suites pass, 0 failures

### Cycle 1962 (Round 23 Feature Implementation) — 2026-03-01

- **Theme**: 6 Sonnet subagent feature round — inset box-shadow, pointer-events, word-spacing, textarea, outline, form visuals
- **Commit**: 0316a9d
- **Features Implemented**:
  - Inset box-shadow: FillInsetShadow PaintCommand with Gaussian falloff, spread/offset, border-radius aware
  - Pointer-events: none — skip in click/mousemove/hover/context-menu hit testing (4 paths)
  - Word-spacing: replaced crude font_size*0.6 with proper CoreText space measurement
  - Textarea: is_textarea flag, rows/cols attributes, paint_textarea rendering
  - Outline rendering: paint_outline with solid/dashed/dotted/double styles + outline-offset
  - Form element visuals: improved checkbox/radio/select rendering
  - List-style: marker positioning improvements
- **Validation**: 13/13 suites pass, 0 failures

### Cycle 1961 (Round 22 Feature Implementation) — 2026-03-01

- **Theme**: 6 Sonnet subagent feature round — conic gradients, border-image, vertical-align, table layout, deep-nesting guards, shell UX
- **Commit**: 78d1eb8
- **Features Implemented**:
  - Conic gradients: complete CSS conic-gradient() parsing (deg/turn/rad/grad, hard stops, repeating-conic-gradient)
  - Border-image: 9-slice rendering with URL image sources, outset, 4 repeat modes (stretch/repeat/round/space)
  - Vertical-align: proper baseline with font ascent, sub/super/text-top/text-bottom/length offsets, two-pass line box algorithm
  - Table layout: fixed coordinate double-offset, rowspan occupancy tracking, colspan width distribution, row height expansion

### Cycle 1958 (Centering Fix Round) — 2026-03-01

- **Theme**: Layout engine centering fixes — flex margin-box, inline-block shrink-wrap re-layout
- **Commit**: 67ece72
- **Fixes**:
  - Flex main-axis: total_used now includes padding/border/margin for correct justify-content

  - Flex cross-axis: align-items uses margin-box dimensions, stretch subtracts margin-box
  - Inline-block shrink-wrap: re-layout with correct width so internal text-align uses actual content area
  - Updated LayoutV163_4 test for correct flex margin-right positioning
- **Verified**: Test 5 (inline-block centering) now matches Chrome in side-by-side comparison

### Tell The Next Claude

- The root-level `/Users/seong-useog/vibrowser/build` cache currently points at a different source tree and fails `cmake -S . -B build` from repo root unless cleaned.
- For the browser engine work, run the required full command from `/Users/seong-useog/vibrowser/vibrowser`.
- High-value next target: continue request/response hardening around malformed header token parsing and fail-closed behavior with focused net tests.

### Tell The Next Codex

- `.codex/codex-estate.md` is write-blocked in this runtime (`operation not permitted`), so Cycle 915 is recorded in `.claude/claude-estate.md` as source of truth for sync-forward.
